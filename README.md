##This repository contains an E-Learning Platform built using only HTML, internal CSS, and basic linking—no JavaScript logic or frameworks involved. This project shows a simple online course portal where users can view and track course progress.

Project Structure
The project is divided into multiple HTML files, each representing a different section of the platform:

index.html – Home Page

courses.html – Courses Dashboard

python.html – Python Course Page

html.html – HTML Course Page

css.html – CSS Course Page

js.html – JavaScript Course Page

Each file is standalone and includes embedded CSS for layout and styling.

🏠 Home Page (index.html)
The homepage welcomes users to the platform with a warm message and a minimal layout. It includes a navigation bar linking to the main Courses page and uses consistent branding with a green header and footer. The page encourages users to explore the course content using the links above.

📚 Courses Dashboard (courses.html)
This is the core of the platform. It lists all the available courses—Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each course is presented in its own styled section, showing the current progress (hardcoded for now), course title, and a “VIEW” button that leads to the course-specific page.

Highlights:

Color-coded and responsive layout

Hover effects for navigation and buttons

Simple progress indicators

📹 Course Pages (python.html, html.html, css.html, js.html)
Each course page maintains the same consistent layout:

A welcoming header and footer

A navigation bar for easy movement between pages

A content section displaying the course title, current progress, and a button that links to a YouTube tutorial

This is especially useful for learners who are just starting with web development, as it shows how to embed video-based learning resources seamlessly.

🎨 Styling & Design
All pages use internal CSS (within the <style> tag) to keep things easy to follow for beginners. The design features:

Green-based theme for consistency and readability

Text shadows for a bit of visual flair

Box shadows and padding for content separation

Hover effects to show interactivity

The site uses the 'Segoe UI' font for a modern and clean appearance.
